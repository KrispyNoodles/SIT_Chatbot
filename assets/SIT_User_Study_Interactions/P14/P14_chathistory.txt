course link for EDE course

I couldn't find a specific link for the Engineering Design and Innovation (EDE) course at SIT. However, you can explore SIT's undergraduate programs and find more information about their engineering courses on their official website. If you have a specific course in mind, you might find it listed under their engineering programs.

Total course fees for electonic and data engineering

The total course fees for the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) in Electronics and Data Engineering at SIT are calculated based on the number of credits and the fee per credit. The program requires 240 credits over a duration of 4 years.

For Singapore Citizens, the subsidized fee per credit is $173.00. Therefore, the total course fee would be 240 credits * $173.00 = $41,520.
For non-subsidized students, the fee per credit is $661.63, making the total course fee 240 credits * $661.63 = $158,791.20.

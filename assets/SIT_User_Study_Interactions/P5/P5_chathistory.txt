User:
Can you give me course fee total?

Chatbot:
To calculate the total course fee, you need to know the total number of credits required for the course and the cost per credit. Once you have these details, you can multiply the total number of credits by the cost per credit to get the total course fee.

For example:
If a course requires 240 credits and each credit costs $173.00, the total course fee would be:

Total Course Fee
=
240
 
credits
×
173.00
/
credit
=
41
,
520
Total Course Fee=240credits×173.00/credit=41,520
If you provide the specific course details, I can help you calculate the total fee.
